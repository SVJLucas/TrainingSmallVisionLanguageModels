</p> 

In recent years, advancements in language modeling have led to the development of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama[1], Mistral[2], ChatGPT[3], and Gemini[4], which can handle a wide variety of tasks. These models, originally limited to text inputs, are now being extended to visual inputs, creating new possibilities for AI applications. Integrating vision and language efficiently is crucial to making this technology more accessible and cost-effective. In this context, the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using pretrained backbones emerges as a powerful solution to simplify training and reduce costs while maintaining high performance[5]. These pretrained models can efficiently process and align visual and textual information, enabling more effective development of VLMs. Models like LLaVA[6] and PaLI[7] demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting the potential for optimized training and improved functionality in VLMs.

In the context of VLMs from Pretrained Backbones, the most known ones are: 

- **LLaVA**[6] (7B and 13B parameters) utilizes CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)[8] and Vicuna[9] to handle diverse tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. It achieves efficient resource utilization and incorporates reinforcement learning from human feedback .
- **PaLI**[7] (3B, 15B and 17B parameters) supports over 100 languages by combining large Vision Transformers (ViT)[10] with mT5[11] text models, trained on the extensive WebLI dataset, demonstrating robust multilingual capabilities .
- **PaliGemma**[12] (3B parameters) , inspired by PaLI-3[13], integrates the SigLIP[14] vision model and the Gemma[15] language model, focusing on multimodal pretraining and high-resolution tasks to balance performance and efficiency .
- **MiniGPT-4**[16] (7B and 13B parameters) effectively align visual features with text token embeddings, reducing computational requirements and enhancing versatility  .

While these models are highly efficient, their large number of parameters often prevents their use in low-compute environments or for tasks that can be achieved with fewer parameters. This highlights the need for smaller models tailored to specific tasks, which can still perform well without requiring extensive computational resources.

## MODA - Multimodal Object Description Assistant


MODA (Multimodal Object Description Assistant) addresses the need for specialized, task-specific Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for fashion item descriptions. With only 280 million parameters, MODA maintains a lightweight architecture that allows it to run efficiently, even without a GPU, making it highly accessible for applications with resource constraints. This specialization highlights MODA's advantage in delivering detailed and accurate fashion descriptions with minimal computational overhead.

</p> 


MODA is built using FashionCLIP[17], a model that integrates the capabilities of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)[8] with fashion-specific datasets, and OPT (Open Pre-trained Transformers)[18] from Meta, a language model. By leveraging these advanced technologies, MODA provides precise and detailed descriptions of various fashion objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining state-of-the-art image and text models for specialized applications.


## Understanding the Dataset Creation Pipeline

Creating high-quality datasets is crucial for training machine learning models, especially in specialized domains like fashion. The dataset creation pipeline illustrated below demonstrates a multi-step process that leverages advanced models like Phi-3 Vision and Phi-3 Instruct to produce refined and structured datasets.

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Dataset Pipeline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff2f586d-50ac-4c7c-8cd6-327a043d9174">
</p> 

### Step 1: **Generating an Initial Image Description with Phi-3 Vision**

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Dataset" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca50ae0-5b0c-4129-bcf2-3481b4307234">
</p> 


The first step in the dataset creation pipeline leverages the power of Phi-3 Vision to generate concise and structured descriptions of fashion items directly from images. This process is based on the principle of Datafree distillation, which aims to create synthetic datasets by extracting the most relevant attributes of a fashion item, such as its gender association, category, color, and intended usage. The approach focuses solely on the item itself, deliberately ignoring unnecessary details like the person wearing the item or any visible text within the image. This ensures that the resulting descriptions are both clear and focused, capturing only the essential characteristics of the item. To guide Phi-3 Vision in this task, the item image is combined with a carefully crafted template, shown bellow:

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Prompt I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1934cc2-9031-4f21-95e6-10778af499db">
</p> 

This prompt instructs the model to analyze the image and produce a brief yet comprehensive description that encapsulates the item's key features. The output is formatted in a simple JSON structure, making it easy to integrate into various data processing or machine learning workflows. For example, Phi-3 Vision might generate a description like "A pink women's blouse with lace trim, perfect for formal occasions," capturing the item's color, gender association, and appropriate usage.

- **Why it Matters:** By generating these initial descriptions using a model licensed under MIT, such as Phi-3 Vision, we can use the outputs as training data for other Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Phi-3 Vision works by extracting visual features from the image and converting them into concise textual descriptions. This process not only ensures that the dataset is highly relevant and accurate, but it also provides a robust foundation for further refinement and enhancement. The transformation of raw image data into structured, machine-readable descriptions is essential for training AI models.

However, **itâ€™s important to note that Phi-3 Vision was initially trained with a strong focus on Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**. For exemple, if we took the image from the training sampled data, as bellow:

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" alt="Sample Item" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b05da3c-d9f3-458a-ae67-5fa378836eea">
</p>


Phi-3 Vision will output the following result:


<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Sample Item Description by Phi-3 Vision" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c1375e3-d27c-48e6-af6f-76b513ac8c7c">
</p> 



This presents a challenge because the inclusion of text from the image is not desired in our model's outputs. The presence of OCR-derived text could complicate the training process and lead to less accurate descriptions, , especially for a smaller model. To address this, we incorporate an additional step where Phi-3 Instruct is used. This model utilizes metadata to refine the initial descriptions, ensuring that any OCR text inadvertently captured by Phi-3 Vision is removed, thereby aligning the final dataset with our specific goals.


### Step 2: **Refining the Description with Metadata Using Phi-3 Instruct**

<p align="center">
  <img width="1000" alt="Pipeline's Second Part" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a148bcb2-5ab2-4c76-a8d3-67aee142c919">
</p> 



After generating the initial description with Phi-3 Vision, the process moves into the refinement stage, where the description is combined with additional metadata to create a more precise and comprehensive final output. This is achieved by feeding the initial description and metadata into a second template, "Prompt II," designed to guide Phi-3 Instruct in refining the description, as shown bellow. The metadata includes key details about the item, such as gender, master category, subcategory, article type, and usage, which are crucial for ensuring that the final description is both accurate and contextually relevant, avoiding possible hallucinations from Phi-3 Vision.

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Prompt II" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6db2654-3519-4604-a57d-c7c4cdf8487e">
</p> 

The refinement process carried out by Phi-3 Instruct is essential because it not only enhances the description by integrating these additional data points but also addresses potential issues that may arise from the initial analysis. As mentioned before, Phi-3 Vision was trained with a strong focus on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which might cause it to include unwanted text from the image in the description. Since this text is not relevant to our dataset and could complicate the training of other Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Phi-3 Instruct plays a vital role in filtering out any OCR-derived content. By doing so, it ensures that the final dataset is free from unnecessary elements and fully aligned with the intended use case.

- **Why it Matters:** This refinement step is crucial because it ensures that the final dataset is both detailed and aligned with the necessary categorizations. By removing any irrelevant OCR text and integrating metadata through sophisticated refinement techniques, the resulting dataset becomes a powerful tool for advanced machine learning applications. This meticulous approach guarantees that the dataset is clean, focused, and ready for use in training AI models, thereby enhancing their accuracy and effectiveness.

### Final Step: **Creating the Final Dataset**

Finally, the refined item description is paired with the original item image to form the final dataset. This dataset is now ready for use in various applications, such as training AI models, product recommendation systems, or cataloging.

- **Why it Matters:** The final dataset, consisting of both high-quality images and precisely refined descriptions, is a valuable resource for any data-driven application in the fashion industry. This step ensures that all the work done in previous steps culminates in a dataset that is both useful and reliable for real-world applications.


This dataset contains over 2900 product images, categorized under Apparel and Footwear, and includes items for Boys, Girls, Men, and Women. The dataset includes a `fashion.csv` file with metadata such as title, description, category, and gender. It is suitable for various applications like category classification, visual similarity-based recommendation systems, custom named entity recognition for attributes like color and gender. Bellow, there are some samples from the [Image Dataset for E-commerce Applications](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikashrajluhaniwal/fashion-images/data):



### 1. Analyzing the Image with Phi-3 Vision


The approach of Datafree distillation using Phi-3 Vision focuses on generating synthetic datasets by creating concise, structured descriptions of fashion items from images. This method involves analyzing an image to extract the most relevant attributes of a fashion item, such as its gender association, category, color, and intended usage. The goal is to produce a clear and concise textual description that accurately represents the item without including unnecessary details, such as the person wearing the item or any text within the image. The descriptions are formatted in a simple JSON structure, which makes them easy to integrate into various data processing or machine learning workflows. Below is the prompt used to instruct Phi-3 Vision in generating these descriptions:


```html
<|user|>

<|image_1|>

Analyze the image and provide a concise description of the fashion item it contains. Focus solely on the item,
not the person wearing or using it, and concentrate on the most prominent or important item in the image.
The description should include details such as gender, category, subcategory, product type, color, and usage.
The output should be in the following JSON format, where the description is a brief text string:

Exemple 1:

{
  "description": "A pink women's blouse with lace trim, perfect for formal occasions."
}


Exemple 2:


{
  "description": "Black men's casual leather shoes, ideal for everyday use."
}


Exemple 3:

{
  "description": "Gold girls' necklace with a heart pendant, suitable for parties."
}


Please ensure the description is concise, capturing the essential attributes of the fashion item, and
formatted as plain text within a JSON structure, following the provided examples.

Do not write the text that is in the image. For exemple, if some text is in the image, ignore it.

<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```

The expected output from this prompt is a concise, structured JSON object that provides a detailed description of the fashion item depicted in the image. Each description should focus on the essential attributes of the item, such as its type, color, and intended use, while ignoring irrelevant details like the wearer or any visible text. The ultimate goal is to create a synthetic dataset of fashion item descriptions that can be used to train machine learning models or enhance product databases. By ensuring that the descriptions are both accurate and standardized, this approach helps to generate high-quality data that can improve the performance our algorithm.


### MODA Architecture

MODA (Multimodal Object Description Assistant) uses a specialized architecture to generate detailed descriptions of fashion items by combining FashionCLIP[17] for image encoding and OPT-125M[18] as decoder for text generation. Its non-linear projection increases and then reduces the dimensionality of image embeddings, capturing complex patterns and enhancing representation quality. This approach allows MODA to deliver accuracy in fashion-specific tasks with only 280 million parameters, making it efficient and capable of running without a GPU.

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b201d3-b1ee-402d-9a4a-2a6f66c2476d">
</p> 

In comparison, models like LLaVA[6] and PaLI[7] adopt a more versatile approach, leveraging pretrained backbones to align visual and textual modalities for a wide range of tasks. LLaVA[6] integrates CLIP[8] and Vicuna[9] with a simple linear projection for efficient resource utilization, while PaLI combines Vision Transformers (ViT)[10] and mT5[11] models also via linear transformation for the same reason. Since MODA is a small model, the use of non-linearity does not impact resource utilization significantly. MODAâ€™s non-linear projection method provides a distinct advantage in capturing intricate visual details, enhancing its performance in generating accurate and detailed descriptions compared to the linear projections used by other models.


### Training

The training of the MODA model aims to optimize its ability to generate detailed descriptions of fashion items by effectively integrating visual and textual data. The process starts with the FashionCLIP[17] model, which processes the input image to generate an embedding. This embedding is then projected to a suitable size through a non-linear projection layer, enhancing its representation quality. Simultaneously, the OPT[18] tokenizer converts the text description (image label) into token embeddings. These image and text embeddings are combined into a sequence and fed into the OPT-125M[18] model, a pre-trained transformer, to predict the next token in the sequence. Then, the model's prediction performance is evaluated using the CrossEntropy loss function.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1000" alt="Training Scheme" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f846bb8-13c5-413b-8de6-7e05677879ae">
</p> 

The training process uses the AdamW[19] optimizer, which starts with a learning rate of 1e-3. To ensure the training is efficient, the learning rate is periodically reduced, dropping by a fixed percentage at regular intervals. During training, similar to LLaVA[6], the FashionCLIP[17] encoder had its parameters frozen, and only the non-linear projection and the language model were trained. The model is trained for 20 epochs, taking 1 hour and 44 minutes to train on a Google Colab A100, with gradient accumulation and periodic model saving to ensure stability and performance.

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Training Chart" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85813aac-d8a0-4c7e-9ef9-fb81f5f62b3d">
</p> 

The training chart shows a sharp decline in both training and validation losses in the initial steps, indicating rapid learning and convergence. As training progresses, losses continue to decrease and stabilize at lower values, demonstrating effective learning and good generalization to validation data. The close alignment between the training (blue line) and validation (orange line) loss curves suggests that the model is not overfitting and maintains good performance on the validation set.
